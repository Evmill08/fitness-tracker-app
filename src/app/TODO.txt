TODO: 
    Errors: 
        - (Fixed I think) Error in API Validate User when it calls getuserbyID, returns all []s (Fixed I think)
        - (Fixed) Incorrect styling of home view components for timer and stats

        - (Fixed) Timer stuff still isnt right. Stops when navigated away from. Should not factor in elapsed time when paused
        - (Fixed) Can still login with incorrect information

        - (Fixed) Exercise cards not appearing in exercise view after being added
        - (Fixed) Exercises only appearing after addition of exercise, then disappearing after refresh
        - (Fixed) Error completing the workout

        - (Fixed) Cannot add or remove sets or muscle groups.
        - (Fixed) Add Exercise card doesnt add muscle groups
        - (Fixed): Literally the entire add exercise component is just fucked

        - (Fixed): Personal Bests do not show up
        - (Fixed): Exercise Cards should not rely workout exercises, should pull from user exercises
        - (Fixed): Update lbs styling, add commas
        - (Fixed): Sometimes current workout shows up for the wrong user (only on first sign in) - probably a check on login/signup

        - (Fixed): Workout Context mad when I finish a workout, might be calling refresh somewhere I shouldn't
        - (Fixed): To solve muscle group thing, just make some sort of dropdown menu to select the muscle groups
        - (Fixed): PBs are wrong after finishing a workout. New workouts are undefined, old pbs are stored with weight 1

        - (Fixed): Workout name updates itself and loops and never finishes
        - (Added): Log Out button
        - (Added): Profile Page should only render (30?) workouts
        - (Fixed): Updating user info just doesn't work, API error.

        - (Not Fixed): Personal Bests aren't working again

    
    - Fix muscle group dropdown styling and logic slightly


    (Added)
    Stats Page:
    - Tab 1: Personal Bests
        - Just a list of personal best cards, ordered by date (newest first)
    - Tab 2: workouts:
        - Workout history summary:
            - Total Workouts, Total Weight, Total Time
        - Github ciontributions style calender of workouts, with filled in being days worked out.
            - Have year filters starting at 2025, and I guess adding one each time a new year passes
